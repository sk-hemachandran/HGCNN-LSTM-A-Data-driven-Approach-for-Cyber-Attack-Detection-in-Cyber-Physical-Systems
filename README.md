# HGCNN-LSTM: A Data-driven Approach for Cyber Attack Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems

## Introduction
HGCNN-LSTM is a data-driven approach designed for the detection of cyber attacks in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This project leverages the strengths of both Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to accurately identify and mitigate potential threats in CPS environments.

## Features
- Combines GCNN and LSTM for robust cyber attack detection
- High accuracy and low false positive rate
- Suitable for a variety of CPS applications
- Scalable and easy to deploy
