# HGCNN-LSTM-A-Data-driven-Approach-for-Cyber-Attack-Detection-in-Cyber-Physical-Systems


Introduction
HGCNN-LSTM is a data-driven approach designed for the detection of cyber attacks in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This project leverages the strengths of both Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to accurately identify and mitigate potential threats in CPS environments.

Features
Combines GCNN and LSTM for robust cyber attack detection
High accuracy and low false positive rate
Suitable for a variety of CPS applications
Scalable and easy to deploy
